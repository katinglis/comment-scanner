 How to Run:

 java -jar CommentScanner.jar
 - When prompted for a file name, enter test.js or test.py or test.java, or any other file you have prepared for testing.
 - The provided test cases are not included here because they contain Capital One copyright code 

 Additional Testing:
 - There's a junit test called CommentScannerTest.java which checks the output for the 3 provided test cases
 
 Design Decisions:
 - Language choice. I chose Java because I saw it listed prominently in the job posting 
   
 Limitations:
 - doesn't deal with comments in strings
 - doesn't deal with multiple comments on the same line: /* comment 1 */ /* comment 2 */ // comment 3
 - only handles .java, .js, .py file extensions
